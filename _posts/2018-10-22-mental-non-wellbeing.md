__What is mental illness?__ It can’t be defined by a single phrase or term because it spans so many spectrums. It causes, anxiety, depression, hallucinations, and so much more. that in the end some people can’t give into it anymore and end their life for being a single person in a world full of communities, finding belonging is so difficult when one does not feel well.

I’ve lived with mental non-wellbeing for quite some time, it has happened because of not some genetic malfunction when I was in the womb of my beloved mother, but through trauma. Trauma is the worst possible emergence of mental non-wellbeing. Because it wasn’t your fault or it was forced upon you.
