Stress is the opposite of being in control. Control cannot be something that canâ€™t be challenged, it's just there - to keep us in check in doing the right thing.

But what keeps us in control then? For if stress is the factor that promotes pressure on our conscious, or mentality, how would we survive?

We do this by cheating! Cheat your stress in thinking that they are in control, but it is you who decides what stress should control.
